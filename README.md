Smart IoT Thermostat (Simulation)

A software-only IoT thermostat system that simulates temperature/humidity sensors, HVAC control logic, a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) GUI, and MQTT-based IoT communication — without requiring physical hardware.

This project demonstrates key skills in IoT, embedded UX, real-time control, and data visualization, making it an excellent reference for embedded systems / IoT portfolios.

🚀 Features

🌡️ Simulated Sensors → Randomized temperature & humidity data.

⚙️ HVAC Control Logic → Simple feedback loop (heating/cooling based on setpoint).

💻 GUI (HMI) → Tkinter interface showing real-time sensor values & system state.

📡 IoT Communication → Local MQTT broker (Mosquitto) for pub/sub simulation.

📊 Data Logging & Visualization → Store readings and plot historical data.
